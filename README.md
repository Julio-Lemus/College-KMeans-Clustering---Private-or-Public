# College-KMeans-Clustering---Private-or-Public
Summary: Uses exploratory data analysis, python data visualization, and K Means Clustering to cluster public or private colleges. 

Libaries used: NumPy, Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib. Sklearn.cluster

This project was part of "Python in Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" on Udemy. KMeans clustering was used to determine whether a college was public or private based on the following features:
◼ Apps Number of applications received
◼ Accept Number of applications accepted
◼ Enroll Number of new students enrolled
◼ Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class
◼ Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class
◼ F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates
◼ P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates
◼ Outstate Out-of-state tuition
◼ Room.Board Room and board costs
◼ Books Estimated book costs
◼ Personal Estimated personal spending
◼ PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.’s
◼ Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree
◼ S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio
◼ perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate
◼ Expend Instructional expenditure per student
◼ Grad.Rate Graduation rate

The steps taken were to first perform exploritory data analysis to understand each feature, build and fit the kmeans model, and evaluate. (We had the private data for learning purposes. *Please note: in most situations you do not have access to real labels per classification*)
